# "Minus K" Passive Vibration Isolation
To build a platform that could isolate vibrations my group used a compressed-spring system enspired by [commercially available technology](https://www.minusk.com/). The linearized model of these springs, for motion perpendicular to their axis, is just like a standard spring but with a negative spring constant. Using a combination of standard tension springs and horizontally mounted compression springs, we were able to support a platform while minimizing its resonant frequency. It took some time to tune it just right without causing instability but we found the results to be pretty impressive!

# Quadcopter Control System
For the final project our group chose to write and tune control loops to stablize and manuever a quadcopter using a Kinect to provide 3D positional feedback. Here you can see it flying along a Lissajous curve:
