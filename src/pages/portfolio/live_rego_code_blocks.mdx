I developed the Rego code block postprocessor with a few key points in mind:
- **Interactivity** - Rego is not only a domain-specific language but also quite *unsusual*.
  The team at Styra had identified interacting with examples as a key way to make learning Rego easier;
  so far they had relied on users following along in a REPL, which was a significant barrier to entry.
- **Compatibility** - We wanted to maintain the documentation's style of interweaving text with examples
  and then modifying or extending those examples later on. There also wasn't motivation
  to alter the current website infrastructure to better support something like this (hence developing a postprocessor
  that operated on the compiled markdown). Finally, the system had to support multiple versions of the documentation
  for different releases.
- **Ease of Use** - The system had to be easy to use for those writing the documentation. A lot of effort was
  put in to ensuring cross-platform and offline build compatibilities as well as compile-time error checking
  and reporting.
- **Speed** - Building the documentation had to be fast for those writing it and the website had to load quickly
  for those interacting with it. Running all the examples when the page loaded wasn't an option.

Here's what I came up with:

# Authoring

Given the requirement to use existing markdown syntax, I settled on a custom format for code block
language strings to encode the needed information:

`````
```live:a/hierarchical/group:type:tag,other_tag,another
# ... some Rego code ...
```
`````

Where `live` is a fixed keyword, `a/hierarchical/group` is a slash-delimited name for the group a block belongs to,
`type` is one of the four variants of block (e.g. `module` or `output`),
and the tags provide additional formatting or error checking information. The full documentation for authoring live blocks
can be found [here](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/tree/master/docs#live-code-blocks).

The hierarchical groups (which tie output blocks to the corresponding inputs) are the most important piece of this syntax;
they allow examples to expand on previous ones and for everything to be interactive without unnecessary duplication. Many of blocks
in the page linked above use a single block of shared data (located at the bottom). Updating that single block affects the output
shown in twenty different places! The words between the code blocks explain these interactions naturally, and restoring
their initial state takes just the click of a button.

# Building

In order to share as much code as possible from the frontend with the compile-time processor, I wrote it in Javascript as well.
It uses the newish async/await syntax (woohoo!) to efficiently download and cache all required OPA binary versions and
evaluate the results that the output blocks should contain. Finally, the client-side JS is compiled, minified, and cached as well
for all subsequent builds.

# Interacting

When the page loads, the client-side code quickly indexes all of the present examples and then hydrates them with the editor.
This happens in order of distance from the current viewport; although hydrating the whole page can take several seconds, whatever you're looking
at is interactive immediately and the page stays responsive. I also took pains to ensure that changes propagate correctly even to blocks that haven't been hydrated yet,
nothing can be left in an incorrect state. To make those changes, async code is used once again, this time to query the
Rego evaluation backend (written in Go) to update the outputs when the user changes any of the interactive blocks from
their initial content.
