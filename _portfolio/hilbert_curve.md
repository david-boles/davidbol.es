This 8x8 collection of tiles were made in Skylineâ€™s Ceramics II class. Taken together, they depict a Hilbert curve. One in a group of similar curves, Hilbert Curves are made out of a single shape, a square missing one side. This shape can theoretically be copied and connected together into an infinitely dense, 2D space filling 1D curve. Each tile represents one of the shapes, with three variations for the different possible connections. They were made by stamping rolled out clay (Soldate) with cone 5 fired negatives. I then dipped the surfaces in cone 10 glazes - the colors you see now!
